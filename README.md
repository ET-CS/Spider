Spider
======

Spider is a Sketch Idea for a web programming language I would like to see (and use).

Spider (The first name came to mind as web builder) is not a language, not a framework,
But more like a memory compiled script language with hot-code-swaping for building web server.

Maybe someday I will build a web-server-compiler, or nginx/apache module to serve this 'demo.s' file
